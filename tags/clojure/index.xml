      <description>Many who did not seek the &amp;ldquo;history&amp;rdquo; thinks:
Did you pick the name based on starting with the word &amp;quot;closure&amp;quot; and replacing the &amp;quot;s&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;j&amp;quot; for Java? It seems pretty likely, but it would be nice to have that confirmed.
Rich Hickey&amp;rsquo;s response (creator of the Clojure):
The name was chosen to be unique. I wanted to involve c (c#), l (lisp) and j (java). Once I came up with Clojure, given the pun on closure, the available domains and vast emptiness of the googlespace, it was an easy decision.</description>
